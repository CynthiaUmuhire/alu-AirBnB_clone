# alu-AirBnB_clone


AirBnB Clone Project
This project is aimed at building an AirBnB clone web application. It involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects and implementing various features such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a text-based interface similar to the Shell, specifically designed for managing the objects of the AirBnB project. It allows you to perform the following operations:

Create a new object (e.g., User, Place)
Retrieve an object from a file or database
Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object


1. A command interpreter, similar to a Shell, for manipulating data without a visual interface. It is ideal for development and debugging purposes.

2. A website (the front-end) that displays the final product to everyone, encompassing both static and dynamic elements.

3. A database or files serving as storage for data, where data is represented as objects.

4. An API that facilitates communication between the front-end and the data, allowing retrieval, creation, deletion, and updating of the data objects.

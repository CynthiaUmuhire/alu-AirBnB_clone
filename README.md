Objectives


1. A command interpreter, similar to a Shell, for manipulating data without a visual interface. It is ideal for development and debugging purposes.

2. A website (the front-end) that displays the final product to everyone, encompassing both static and dynamic elements.

3. A database or files serving as storage for data, where data is represented as objects.

4. An API that facilitates communication between the front-end and the data, allowing retrieval, creation, deletion, and updating of the data objects.
